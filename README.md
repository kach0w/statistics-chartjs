## About
 - My stats class just started and because we were only going to start using calculators next week I wanted to make something to graph and display data from points that a user inputs.

 - I was inspired by <a href="https://github.com/oliver-ni/rsquared">this</a>.

 - View more about this project in my <a href="https://kachow.me/blog">blog</a>.

## Edit (10/21/22):
  - Today I added some mising features with the column names.
  - Also, there doesn't seem to be any histogram chart in chartjs so the ability to get statistics like mean, median mode, or standard deviation seems limited. 
  - Therefore, this project seems to be over. I might come back to it if chartjs adds some new, cool charts.

## Edit (4/15/23):
 - Heroku wasn't working so I used Netlify instead
